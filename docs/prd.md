## Security Best Practices

The following security best practices are mandatory and must be actively addressed throughout the project's development and deployment.

1.  Input Sanitization/Validation:

    -   All external inputs, including API request bodies, user-provided data, and file uploads, must undergo strict validation and sanitization at the system's boundary (the Firebase Functions serving as API endpoints).
    -   Node.js Firebase Functions: Use a robust schema validation library such as Joi or Zod to define and enforce strict schemas for all incoming JSON payloads, query parameters, and route parameters.
    -   Python Firebase Functions: Use a robust data validation library such as Pydantic to define models and enforce data types and constraints for all incoming data.
    -   File Upload Validation: Beyond standard request validation, file uploads must be explicitly validated for:
        -   Size Limits: Enforce maximum file size limits as per tool specifications.
        -   MIME Types: Verify accepted file types based on the detected MIME type and magic bytes (where appropriate), rather than just file extension.
        -   Basic structural integrity (e.g., ensuring a PDF is actually a PDF). Malware scanning is a post-MVP consideration.
2.  Output Encoding:

    -   Frontend (React): Rely on React's JSX auto-escaping for rendering dynamic content. Avoid using dangerouslySetInnerHTML unless content is explicitly sanitized using a library like DOMPurify.
    -   Backend (Firebase Functions): As the primary output format is JSON, standard JSON serialization inherently mitigates XSS. For any dynamic content that might be embedded into HTML, XML, or other formats (e.g., in error messages or logs that might be displayed externally), explicit encoding using language-specific safe encoding functions (e.g., Node.js lodash.escape, Python html.escape) is mandatory.
3.  Secrets Management:

    -   Policy: Secrets (API keys, credentials, sensitive configuration values) must never be hardcoded, committed to source control (Git), or directly logged.
    -   Access: Secrets must only be accessed through a designated configuration module or service, ensuring they are loaded securely at runtime.
    -   Storage:
        -   Firebase Functions / Google Cloud Run: Secrets will be managed via Google Cloud environment variables, which are securely stored and injected at deployment time.
        -   Local Development: For local development, .env files (explicitly listed in .gitignore) can be used to store secrets, ensuring they are not committed to the repository.
        -   Documentation: Detailed guidelines on managing environment variables and secrets will be available in a dedicated document (e.g., docs/environment-vars.md).
4.  Dependency Security:

    -   Automated Vulnerability Scanning: Automated vulnerability scans must be run as an integral part of the CI/CD pipeline for all dependencies.
        -   JavaScript/TypeScript: Utilize npm audit or yarn audit, and integrate with third-party tools like Dependabot (GitHub) or Snyk for continuous monitoring and automated pull requests for vulnerability fixes.
        -   Python: Utilize pip-audit and integrate with Snyk or similar tools.
    -   Update Policy: Vulnerable dependencies must be updated promptly based on their severity: Critical and High severity vulnerabilities must be addressed immediately, while medium and low severity ones should be prioritized for the next sprint or as part of regular maintenance.
    -   Adding New Dependencies: A formal vetting process is required before adding new third-party dependencies, including:
        -   Reviewing the dependency's security track record.
        -   Checking for existing alternatives within the project or standard libraries.
        -   Performing an initial vulnerability scan.
5.  Authentication/Authorization Checks:

    -   All API endpoints (except explicitly public ones) must enforce authentication using the central auth module/middleware.
    -   Authorization (permission/role checks) must be performed at the service layer or entry point for protected resources.
    -   Patterns: Implement reusable authentication and authorization middleware or decorators within Firebase Functions to ensure consistent enforcement across relevant endpoints.
6.  Principle of Least Privilege (Implementation):

    -   Database connection users must have only the necessary permissions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for the specific tables/schemas they access.
    -   IAM roles for cloud services must be narrowly scoped to the required actions and resources.
7.  API Security (General):

    -   Enforce HTTPS for all communication.
    -   Implement rate limiting and throttling at the API Gateway level (via Firebase Functions custom logic or external services like Cloudflare if adopted post-MVP) to protect against abuse and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
    -   HTTP Security Headers: The Google Cloud Run service hosting the frontend will be configured to serve essential HTTP security headers, including:
        -   Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
        -   Content-Security-Policy (CSP) - carefully crafted to mitigate XSS by controlling resource loading.
        -   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
        -   X-Frame-Options: DENY (to prevent clickjacking)
    -   Follow RESTful API design principles, avoiding sensitive information in URLs and using appropriate HTTP methods.
8.  Error Handling & Information Disclosure:

    -   Error messages returned to the frontend (end-user) must be generic and abstract, providing no sensitive technical details (e.g., stack traces, internal file paths, database query specifics, exact library versions).
    -   Detailed error information, including full stack traces and relevant contextual data, must be logged server-side to Google Cloud Logging for debugging and monitoring by development and operations teams.
    -   Consider providing unique, non-sensitive "error IDs" to the client for critical failures, allowing developers to correlate client-side reports with server-side logs.
9.  Regular Security Audits/Testing:

    -   Automated Scans in CI: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools (e.g., using ESLint security plugins for Node.js, Bandit for Python) and container image vulnerability scanning (e.g., Google Container Analysis) into the CI/CD pipelines.
    -   Dynamic Analysis: Explore integrating Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) for more comprehensive security testing in staging environments.
    -   Penetration Testing: Plan for periodic third-party penetration testing to identify overlooked vulnerabilities and validate the effectiveness of implemented security controls, particularly before major releases or in post-MVP phases.

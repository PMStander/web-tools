# Task: Create Deployment Plan

## Description
Create a comprehensive deployment plan for implementing the project in production environments, including infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD pipeline configuration, and operational monitoring.

## Input Required
- System architecture documentation
- Environment requirements
- Release timeline
- Security and compliance requirements

## Steps

1. **Environment Planning**
   - Define all required environments (dev, staging, production)
   - Document infrastructure requirements for each environment
   - Identify cloud services or on-premise resources needed
   - Define network architecture and security groups

2. **Infrastructure as Code Development**
   - Create IaC templates (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
   - Define resource provisioning and configuration
   - Implement environment-specific configurations
   - Establish state management and versioning

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Design**
   - Design build pipeline stages and workflows
   - Define deployment strategies (blue/green, canary, etc.)
   - Configure automated testing integration
   - Implement approval gates and quality checks
   - Design rollback mechanisms

4. **Security Implementation**
   - Define IAM roles and permissions
   - Implement secrets management
   - Configure network security controls
   - Implement security scanning in the pipeline
   - Document compliance measures

5. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Design logging architecture
   - Configure monitoring for infrastructure and applications
   - Set up alerting thresholds and notifications
   - Implement performance metrics collection
   - Create operational dashboards

6. **Disaster Recovery Planning**
   - Define backup strategies and frequency
   - Document restore procedures
   - Design high availability configurations
   - Create incident response procedures

7. **Deployment Procedure Documentation**
   - Document step-by-step deployment processes
   - Create operational runbooks
   - Define deployment verification procedures
   - Document troubleshooting guides

8. **Review and Validation**
   - Review plan for completeness and feasibility
   - Validate against security and compliance requirements
   - Ensure alignment with project timelines
   - Verify resource requirements are accounted for

## Output
A comprehensive deployment plan document that includes:
- Infrastructure architecture diagrams
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Security controls and compliance measures
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Deployment procedures and runbooks
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Validation Criteria
- Plan adheres to DevOps best practices
- Security and compliance requirements are addressed
- Automated deployment pipeline is fully defined
- Monitoring and alerting is comprehensive
- Rollback procedures are clearly documented
- Plan is aligned with project timelines and resources

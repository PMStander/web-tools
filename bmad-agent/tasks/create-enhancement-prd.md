# Create Enhancement PRD Task

## Task Summary
Create or update a Product Requirements Document (PRD) that incorporates competitive analysis insights and defines enhancement requirements for existing modules.

## Prerequisites
- Existing PRD or system documentation
- Competitive analysis results
- Current system capabilities documented
- Stakeholder input on priorities

## Primary Objectives
1. **Document Enhancement Requirements**: Define clear requirements for competitive improvements
2. **Prioritize Features**: Rank enhancements by business value and user impact
3. **Define Success Metrics**: Establish measurable goals for each enhancement
4. **Create Implementation Roadmap**: Plan phased delivery approach

## Task Steps

### Step 1: Review Competitive Analysis
- Analyze competitor feature gap analysis
- Review architectural recommendations
- Understand technical feasibility assessments
- Identify strategic opportunities

### Step 2: Define Enhancement Requirements
- Document functional requirements for each enhancement
- Specify non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
- Define user stories and acceptance criteria
- Establish integration requirements with existing features

### Step 3: Prioritize Enhancements
- Assess business value and user impact
- Consider implementation complexity and effort
- Evaluate competitive urgency
- Balance quick wins with strategic investments

### Step 4: Create Implementation Roadmap
- Define release phases and milestones
- Sequence enhancements for maximum value delivery
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Plan resource allocation and timeline estimates

### Step 5: Define Success Metrics
- Establish KPIs for each enhancement
- Define user adoption and engagement metrics
- Set competitive positioning benchmarks
- Create testing and validation criteria

### Step 6: Document Requirements
- Create comprehensive PRD document
- Include user personas and use cases
- Specify technical constraints and assumptions
- Document risk mitigation strategies

## Deliverables

### Primary Output: Enhancement PRD Document
**Filename**: `enhancement-prd.md` or update existing `prd.md`
**Location**: `docs/`
**Contents**:
- Executive summary of enhancement strategy
- Detailed feature requirements and specifications
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Implementation roadmap with phases
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Risk assessment and mitigation plans

### Secondary Outputs:
1. **Feature Backlog**: Prioritized enhancement features
2. **Epic Definitions**: High-level feature groupings
3. **Release Planning**: Phased delivery schedule

## Success Criteria
- Clear, actionable enhancement requirements
- Prioritized feature roadmap
- Measurable success criteria
- Stakeholder alignment on priorities
- Technical feasibility validated

## Templates and References
- Use [PRD Template](../templates/prd-tmpl.md) for document structure
- Reference competitive analysis documents
- Follow BMAD naming conventions

## Integration Points
- Builds on Architect's competitive feature analysis
- Feeds into SM's story creation process
- Guides Design Architect's UX enhancement work
- Informs development prioritization

## Notes for Agent Execution
- Focus on user value and business outcomes
- Balance competitive positioning with product vision
- Consider technical debt and system constraints
- Ensure requirements are testable and measurable
- Maintain alignment with overall product strategy

# Platform Change Management Task

## Objective
Implement platform infrastructure changes with focus on developer experience, security, and operational excellence while maintaining system reliability and compliance.

## Input Required
- Platform change request (`docs/platform/{change-id}.platform.md`)
- Platform architecture document (`docs/platform-architecture.md` if available)
- Technology stack document (`docs/tech-stack.md` if available)
- Security and compliance requirements

## Prerequisites
1. **Verify Change Request Approval**
   - Confirm platform change request exists and is approved
   - Review change scope, requirements, and acceptance criteria
   - Validate security and compliance requirements

2. **Review Context Documents**
   - Platform architecture and current state
   - Technology stack and constraints
   - Security guidelines and compliance frameworks
   - Developer experience requirements

## Task Execution Steps

### 1. Planning and Risk Assessment
- **Create Implementation Plan**
  - Break down change into manageable components
  - Identify dependencies and prerequisites
  - Define rollback strategy and recovery procedures
  - Estimate resource requirements and timeline

- **Risk Analysis**
  - Assess impact on existing services and developer workflows
  - Identify potential failure points and mitigation strategies
  - Review security implications and compliance requirements
  - Document cost implications and optimization opportunities

### 2. Infrastructure as Code Implementation
- **Develop IaC Templates**
  - Create or update infrastructure templates following best practices
  - Implement configuration management and state tracking
  - Include monitoring, logging, and alerting configurations
  - Ensure version control and change tracking

- **Security and Compliance Integration**
  - Implement security controls and access management
  - Configure compliance monitoring and audit trails
  - Set up secret management and encryption
  - Validate against security policies and frameworks

### 3. Developer Experience Optimization
- **Self-Service Capabilities**
  - Design and implement developer-friendly interfaces
  - Create documentation and onboarding materials
  - Implement automated provisioning and management tools
  - Set up feedback mechanisms and support channels

- **Platform APIs and Tooling**
  - Develop or configure platform APIs for developer access
  - Integrate with existing developer tools and workflows
  - Implement monitoring and observability for developer metrics
  - Create troubleshooting guides and runbooks

### 4. Testing and Validation
- **Non-Production Testing**
  - Deploy changes in staging/development environments
  - Execute functional and integration tests
  - Validate security controls and compliance measures
  - Test disaster recovery and rollback procedures

- **Performance and Reliability Testing**
  - Conduct load testing and capacity validation
  - Verify monitoring and alerting functionality
  - Test service mesh and communication patterns
  - Validate backup and recovery procedures

### 5. Production Deployment
- **Deployment Execution**
  - Follow approved deployment procedures and change windows
  - Implement gradual rollout strategies (blue/green, canary)
  - Monitor system health and performance metrics
  - Validate all services and integrations

- **Post-Deployment Validation**
  - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
  - Test developer workflows and self-service capabilities
  - Confirm monitoring and alerting are operational
  - Document any deviations or issues encountered

### 6. Documentation and Handoff
- **Update Documentation**
  - Update platform architecture documentation
  - Create or update operational runbooks
  - Document new developer workflows and capabilities
  - Update disaster recovery and incident response procedures

- **Knowledge Transfer**
  - Brief operations team on changes and new procedures
  - Update developer documentation and onboarding materials
  - Create training materials for new platform capabilities
  - Schedule knowledge sharing sessions if needed

## Output Deliverables
1. **Platform Change Report** - Comprehensive summary of changes implemented
2. **Updated Documentation** - Architecture, runbooks, and developer guides
3. **Monitoring Dashboard** - Platform health and performance metrics
4. **Developer Onboarding Guide** - How to use new platform capabilities
5. **Incident Response Updates** - Updated procedures for new components

## Success Criteria
- All platform changes deployed successfully without service disruption
- Developer experience metrics show improvement or maintain baseline
- Security and compliance requirements fully satisfied
- Monitoring and alerting operational for all new components
- Documentation updated and accessible to relevant teams
- Rollback procedures tested and validated

## Quality Assurance
- **Security Review**: All changes reviewed against security policies
- **Compliance Validation**: Audit trail and compliance measures verified
- **Performance Baseline**: Performance metrics meet or exceed requirements
- **Developer Feedback**: Positive feedback on new capabilities and workflows
- **Operational Readiness**: Operations team trained and prepared for support

## Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Use actual current date in YYYY-MM-DD format for all timestamps
- **File Naming**: Follow BMAD standard naming conventions (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Change Tracking**: Maintain detailed logs in `.ai/platform-changes.md`
- **Approval Required**: New external services or tools require explicit user approval
- **Cost Optimization**: Include cost analysis and optimization recommendations

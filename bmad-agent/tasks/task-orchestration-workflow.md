# Task Orchestration Workflow

## Overview
This orchestration system manages a 3-agent workflow that systematically executes tasks and sub-tasks with built-in code review and implementation loops. The system ensures quality through coordinated multi-agent execution with your existing BMAD agents.

## Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy

### Required Agent Setup
To execute this workflow, you need to open **3 separate agent sessions**:

1. **Primary Session**: TaskExec agent (`*TaskExec` or use Task Executor persona)
2. **Review Session**: Reviewer agent (`*Reviewer` or use Code Reviewer persona) 
3. **Implementation Session**: Changer agent (`*Changer` or use Change Implementer persona)

## Step-by-Step Execution Instructions

### Phase 1: Setup Multi-Agent Environment

1. **Open First Session** (Primary Orchestrator)
   ```
   *TaskExec
   ```
   This becomes your **Task Execution Agent**

2. **Open Second Session** (Code Review)
   ```
   *Reviewer  
   ```
   This becomes your **Code Review Agent**

3. **Open Third Session** (Change Implementation)
   ```
   *Changer
   ```
   This becomes your **Change Implementation Agent**

### Phase 2: Initialize Task Execution

#### In TaskExec Session:
```
*task-flow {task-name}
```
**TaskExec Response Expected:**
- Break down main task into sub-tasks
- Create execution plan with clear deliverables
- Execute first sub-task
- Provide clear handoff materials

### Phase 3: Review Cycle Execution

#### Switch to Reviewer Session:
```
Review the implementation from TaskExec session:
[Copy/paste the TaskExec deliverables here]

Please review this implementation against requirements and provide specific feedback.
```

**Reviewer Response Expected:**
- âœ… **Approve**: "Implementation approved. Proceed to next sub-task."
- ðŸ”„ **Request Changes**: Specific list of changes needed
- ðŸš« **Major Revision**: Fundamental rework required

### Phase 4: Change Implementation (If Needed)

#### If Reviewer Requests Changes - Switch to Changer Session:
```
Implement the following changes from code review:
[Copy/paste specific reviewer feedback here]

Original implementation:
[Copy/paste original TaskExec work here]
```

**Changer Response Expected:**
- Implement all requested changes
- Test modifications
- Provide updated implementation
- Document what was changed

#### Return to Reviewer Session for Re-review:
```
Please re-review the updated implementation:
[Copy/paste Changer's updated work here]

Changes made:
[Copy/paste Changer's change summary here]
```

### Phase 5: Sub-task Completion and Iteration

#### On Approval - Return to TaskExec Session:
```
Sub-task approved. Please proceed to next sub-task.

Completed sub-task: [summary]
Next sub-task: [if any remaining]
```

**Repeat Phases 3-5 for each sub-task until all complete**

## Practical Example: Implementing User Authentication

### Session 1 (TaskExec):
```
*task-flow implement-user-authentication
```

**TaskExec breaks down into sub-tasks:**
1. Create user model and database schema
2. Implement registration endpoint
3. Implement login endpoint  
4. Add JWT token generation
5. Create password hashing utilities
6. Add authentication middleware

**TaskExec executes sub-task 1 and provides:**
- Database migration file
- User model definition
- Schema documentation

### Session 2 (Reviewer):
```
Review the user authentication database implementation:

Files created:
- migrations/001_create_users.sql
- models/User.js 
- docs/user-schema.md

[Copy actual implementation here]

Please review against security best practices and project standards.
```

**Reviewer might respond:**
```
ðŸ”„ Changes Requested:
1. Add unique constraint on email field
2. Include created_at/updated_at timestamps  
3. Add password field length validation
4. Consider adding user status field (active/inactive)
```

### Session 3 (Changer):
```
Implement the following database schema changes:

1. Add unique constraint on email field
2. Include created_at/updated_at timestamps
3. Add password field length validation  
4. Consider adding user status field (active/inactive)

Original implementation:
[Copy TaskExec's original work]
```

**Changer implements changes and returns to Reviewer for approval**

### Continue Process:
- Once approved, return to TaskExec for sub-task 2
- Repeat review cycle for each sub-task
- Complete all 6 sub-tasks with quality assurance

## Command Integration

### Workflow Commands
| Command | Session | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `*task-flow {task-name}` | TaskExec | Start 3-agent workflow execution |
| `*task-flow-next` | TaskExec | Move to next sub-task after approval |
| `*task-flow-status` | Any | Show current workflow progress |
| `*task-flow-handoff` | Any | Generate handoff summary for next agent |

## Execution Instructions

### Phase 1: Task Initialization
1. **Parse task requirements** from task file or user input
2. **Break down main task** into logical sub-tasks
3. **Create execution plan** with checkpoints
4. **Initialize tracking system** for progress monitoring

### Phase 2: Sub-task Execution Loop
For each sub-task:

#### Step 1: Task Executor Agent
- **Analyze sub-task requirements**
- **Implement solution** following BMAD conventions
- **Create deliverable** (code, documentation, configuration)
- **Document implementation** approach and decisions
- **Hand off to Code Review Agent**

#### Step 2: Code Review Agent  
- **Review implementation** against requirements
- **Check code quality** and adherence to standards
- **Identify potential issues** or improvements
- **Provide specific feedback** with actionable suggestions
- **Make approve/reject decision**

#### Step 3: Change Implementation Agent (if changes needed)
- **Analyze reviewer feedback**
- **Implement suggested changes**
- **Test modifications** for correctness
- **Document changes made**
- **Return to Code Review Agent** for re-review

#### Step 4: Approval and Progression
- **On approval**: Mark sub-task complete, proceed to next
- **On rejection**: Loop back to Change Implementation Agent
- **Track iteration count** to prevent infinite loops

### Phase 3: Task Completion
1. **Verify all sub-tasks** completed successfully
2. **Run final integration tests** if applicable
3. **Generate completion report** with summary
4. **Update project documentation** as needed

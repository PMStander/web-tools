# Task: Create Test Plan

## Description
Create a comprehensive test plan for a specific story, feature, or component, ensuring all functional and non-functional requirements are adequately tested.

## Input Required
- Story or feature documentation
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical architecture documents (if available)

## Steps

1. **Review Requirements**
   - Review the story/feature description thoroughly
   - Identify all explicit and implicit requirements
   - Clarify any ambiguous requirements with the user

2. **Test Scope Definition**
   - Define what will and will not be tested
   - Identify test environments required
   - Determine test data needs
   - Identify dependencies and prerequisites

3. **Test Strategy Development**
   - Determine appropriate test types needed:
     - Unit testing
     - Integration testing
     - End-to-end testing
     - Performance testing
     - Security testing
     - Accessibility testing
     - Usability testing
   - Define test approach for each test type
   - Document tools and frameworks to be used

4. **Test Case Design**
   - Create test cases for each acceptance criterion
   - Include positive, negative, and edge cases
   - Define detailed test steps with expected results
   - Create data requirements for each test case
   - Define any specific preconditions needed

5. **Test Automation Strategy**
   - Identify which test cases should be automated
   - Define automation framework and approach
   - Plan for test maintenance and reliability

6. **Test Execution Planning**
   - Define test execution schedule
   - Identify resources needed for testing
   - Define entry and exit criteria for test phases
   - Plan for regression testing

7. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify testing risks and mitigation strategies
   - Prioritize testing based on risk assessment

8. **Review and Finalize**
   - Review test plan for completeness and clarity
   - Ensure test coverage is adequate
   - Verify alignment with project quality standards
   - Finalize and document the test plan

## Output
A comprehensive test plan document that includes:
- Test strategy overview
- Detailed test cases with steps and expected results
- Test data requirements
- Test environment specifications
- Risks and mitigation strategies
- Test execution schedule

## Validation Criteria
- Test plan covers all acceptance criteria
- Test cases include positive, negative, and edge cases
- Automation strategy is clearly defined
- Risks are properly identified and addressed
- Plan is executable within project constraints

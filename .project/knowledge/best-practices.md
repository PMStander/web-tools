# Development Best Practices

This document outlines general best practices for software development projects using this project management system.

## Architecture

### Modular Development
- Design modules to be independent and loosely coupled
- Use standardized integration patterns for cross-module functionality
- Maintain clear boundaries between modules
- Follow consistent directory structure across modules

### Core/Shared Layer Development
- Keep shared functionality focused on truly common needs
- Provide clear interfaces for module integration
- Document all shared components, services, and utilities
- Ensure backward compatibility when making changes
- Follow framework-specific conventions for directory structure
- Consolidate similar functionality to avoid duplication

## Code Quality

### Type Safety
- Use proper type definitions for all code
- Avoid using `any` type except when absolutely necessary
- Create and use interfaces for complex data structures
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Leverage static analysis tools

### Component Design
- Follow established component design guidelines
- Use clear input/output patterns
- Document component interfaces thoroughly
- Create reusable components for common patterns
- Use composition over inheritance

### State Management
- Use appropriate state management solutions for your framework
- Use composables or similar patterns for reusable logic
- Keep state close to where it's used
- Avoid deep prop drilling through proper state architecture

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for all components and utilities
- Use test-driven development when appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error handling

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Test module integration with shared layers
- Verify event handling and state updates

### End-to-End Testing
- Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Test across module boundaries
- Verify that the system works as a whole

## Performance

### Optimization
- Use lazy loading for routes and components
- Optimize images and assets
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders or computations

### Monitoring
- Use performance monitoring tools
- Track key performance metrics
- Identify and address bottlenecks
- Set up performance budgets

## Security

### Authentication
- Use appropriate authentication solutions for your platform
- Implement proper role-based access control
- Validate user permissions on both client and server
- Follow security best practices for your chosen auth provider

### Data Protection
- Sanitize user input
- Use proper data access controls
- Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document complex logic with comments
- Use appropriate documentation standards for your language
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
- Document APIs and public interfaces

### Component Documentation
- Document all components with their interfaces
- Provide usage examples
- Include edge cases and limitations
- Maintain up-to-date documentation

### Architecture Documentation
- Keep architecture documentation up to date
- Document design decisions and rationales
- Use diagrams to illustrate complex systems
- Document integration patterns and dependencies

## Workflow

### Version Control
- Use feature branches for development
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep pull requests focused on a single concern
- Review code before merging
- Use conventional commit messages when possible

### Issue Tracking
- Create clear, actionable issues
- Link issues to pull requests
- Update issue status as work progresses
- Use labels and milestones for organization

### Communication
- Document decisions and discussions
- Share knowledge with the team
- Ask for help when needed
- Maintain project documentation and knowledge base

## Project Management

### Task Management
- Break down work into manageable tasks
- Use the project's task management system
- Track progress and update status regularly
- Document lessons learned

### Quality Assurance
- Follow the project's quality standards
- Use performance scoring when available
- Conduct regular code reviews
- Maintain test coverage

## Prompt Customization Tips

### For Better Results
- **Be specific**: Include concrete details about your project
- **Provide context**: Explain your current situation and goals
- **Set expectations**: Clarify what level of detail you need
- **Include constraints**: Mention any limitations or requirements

### Common Customizations
- **Technology stack**: Specify your exact frameworks and tools
- **Team size**: Adjust recommendations for your team structure
- **Project stage**: Indicate if you're starting, mid-development, or maintaining
- **Focus areas**: Emphasize what's most important for your current needs

## Workflow Integration

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: Use `update-context.md` to review current priorities
2. **During work**: Create modules with `create-module.md` as needed
3. **Evening**: Use `update-context.md` to log progress and set next steps

### Weekly Workflow
1. **Monday**: Review and update project context
2. **Wednesday**: Mid-week progress check and adjustments
3. **Friday**: Weekly analysis and planning for next week

### Monthly Workflow
1. **First week**: Comprehensive project analysis
2. **Second week**: Implement high-priority improvements
3. **Third week**: Update documentation and processes
4. **Fourth week**: Plan for next month and review progress

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Prompts
You can combine elements from different prompts for specific needs:
```markdown
I want to create a new module AND analyze how it fits into the overall project architecture...
```

### Custom Prompts
Create your own prompts by:
1. Following the structure of existing prompts
2. Including specific tasks and guidelines
3. Adding your organization's standards and requirements
4. Testing and refining based on results

### Automation Integration
These prompts can be integrated with:
- **Git hooks**: Trigger context updates on commits
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Run analysis on builds
- **Scheduled tasks**: Regular project health checks
- **IDE extensions**: Quick access to common prompts

## Troubleshooting

### If Prompts Don't Work as Expected
1. **Check file access**: Ensure LLM can read project files
2. **Verify structure**: Confirm project management system is properly set up
3. **Review customization**: Make sure placeholders are filled correctly
4. **Simplify scope**: Try focusing on fewer tasks at once

### Common Issues
- **Incomplete output**: Break large prompts into smaller parts
- **Generic responses**: Provide more specific project details
- **Missing files**: Run system validation to check completeness
- **Inconsistent format**: Specify exact format requirements

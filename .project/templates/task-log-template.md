- +1: Provides a portable or reusable solution.

#### Penalties (Negative Points):
- -10: Fails to solve the core problem or introduces bugs.
- -5: Contains placeholder comments or lazy output.
- -5: Uses inefficient algorithms when better options exist.
- -3: Violates style conventions or includes unnecessary code.
- -2: Misses obvious edge cases that could break the solution.
- -1: Overcomplicates the solution beyond what's needed.
- -1: Relies on deprecated or suboptimal libraries/functions.
